Hello Vazir,
As discussed with you and Aravind on 31-Jan-2020, I am raising my resignation. Let me know the exit 
process and my last working day. 

Note: As informed today, my father has to undergo an eye surgery on Thursday (13-02-2020) I’ll not be 
able to come to office on Wednesday and Thursday (12-02-2020 and 13-02-2020).

Thanks & Regards,
